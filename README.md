# Taco Shop Website

## Introduction
Welcome to this repository! This project is a mock-up website for a taco shop and serves as a personal learning project. It's crafted with HTML and minimal CSS. 

## Disclaimer
This website is **not a real taco shop**; it's a project created for educational purposes. The contact form present on the site is purely for demonstration and **does not store any data** entered, as there is no database connected to it.

## Website Structure
The website is organized into three separate HTML pages, ensuring that information is easily accessible and navigable:
- `index.html`: The main landing page.
- `hours.html`
- `contact.html`

- **YouTube Tutorials**: 
  - FreeCodeCamp.org by Dave Gray
  - SuperSimpleDev

  - W3Schools for reference and guidance.

## Acknowledgments
